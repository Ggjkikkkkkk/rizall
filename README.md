To display an image in HTML, you can use the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Image Example</title>
</head>
<body>

    <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">

</body>
</html>
```

Replace "image.jpg" with the path to the image you want to display and provide a brief description in the "alt" attribute.
